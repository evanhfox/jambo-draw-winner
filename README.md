# Contest Draw Platform üé≤

A secure, auditable, and truly random contest draw platform built with React, TypeScript, and cryptographically secure randomization.

## üîí Security Features

- **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for true randomness
- **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: Mathematically proven unbiased selection algorithm
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation with timestamps and unique draw IDs
- **Transparent Process**: Detailed explanations and visual demonstrations
- **Downloadable Reports**: TXT and JSON audit reports for verification

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Production deployment
npm run docker:prod

# Development with hot reload
npm run docker:dev
```

### Local Development

```bash
