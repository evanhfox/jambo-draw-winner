# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation üöÄ

This document describes the complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Contest Draw Platform.

## üìã Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and follows a **sequential phase-based approach** with proper dependency management. The pipeline ensures code quality, security, and reliable deployments.

## üéØ Pipeline Phases

### Phase 1: Quality Assurance & Testing
**Job Name:** `quality-assurance`

**Purpose:** Ensures code quality and functionality through comprehensive testing.

**Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Setup Bun Runtime** - Installs the Bun JavaScript runtime
3. **Install Dependencies** - Installs all project dependencies
4. **Run Unit Tests with Coverage** - Executes the full test suite with coverage analysis
5. **Upload Test Coverage to Codecov** - Sends coverage data to Codecov for analysis

**Triggers:** Every push and pull request
**Dependencies:** None (entry point)
**Outputs:** `tests-passed` (boolean)

### Phase 2: Security Vulnerability Assessment
**Job Name:** `security-assessment`

**Purpose:** Scans the codebase for security vulnerabilities and potential threats.

**Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Retrieves the latest code
2. **Run Trivy Filesystem Vulnerability Scan** - Performs comprehensive security scanning
3. **Upload Security Scan Results to GitHub** - Integrates results with GitHub Security tab
4. **Display Vulnerability Report** - Shows detailed vulnerability information

**Triggers:** Every push, pull request, and weekly (Monday 2 AM UTC)
**Dependencies:** `quality-assurance` (only runs if tests pass)
**Permissions:** `contents: read`, `security-events: write`

### Phase 3: Application Build & Packaging
**Job Name:** `application-build`

**Purpose:** Builds the production-ready application bundle.

**Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Retrieves the latest code
2. **Setup Bun Runtime** - Installs Bun for building
3. **Install Dependencies** - Installs all dependencies
4. **Build Production Application** - Creates optimized production build
5. **Upload Build Artifacts** - Stores build artifacts for deployment

**Triggers:** Every push and pull request
**Dependencies:** `quality-assurance`, `security-assessment`
**Artifacts:** `production-build` (dist/ directory)

### Phase 4: Container Image Build
**Job Name:** `container-build`

**Purpose:** Creates a Docker container image for the application.

**Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Retrieves the latest code
2. **Set up Docker Buildx** - Configures Docker for multi-platform builds
3. **Build Production Container Image** - Creates Docker image with caching
4. **Verify Container Image Build** - Confirms successful image creation

**Triggers:** Every push and pull request
**Dependencies:** `quality-assurance`, `security-assessment`
**Image Tag:** `jambo-draw-winner:latest`

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
**Job Name:** `production-deployment`

**Purpose:** Deploys the application to GitHub Pages for public access.

**Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Retrieves the latest code
2. **Setup Bun Runtime for Deployment** - Prepares Bun for deployment build
3. **Install Dependencies** - Installs dependencies
4. **Build Application for Production** - Creates deployment-ready build
5. **Upload Production Build Artifacts** - Prepares artifacts for Pages deployment

**Triggers:** Only on `main` branch pushes
**Dependencies:** `quality-assurance`, `application-build`, `container-build`
**Artifacts:** `production-deployment` (dist/ directory)

## üîß Configuration Details

### Environment Variables
```yaml
REGISTRY: ghcr.io
IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
```

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push to main:** Full pipeline including deployment
- **Pull Request:** All phases except deployment
- **Weekly Schedule:** Security assessment (Monday 2 AM UTC)

### Caching Strategy
- **Docker Build Cache:** Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Dependency Cache:** Bun automatically caches dependencies

## üìä Pipeline Status Indicators

| Phase | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| üü¢ Quality Assurance | Passed | All tests pass, code quality maintained |
| üü° Security Assessment | Running | Scanning for vulnerabilities |
| üîµ Application Build | Building | Creating production bundle |
| üü£ Container Build | Building | Creating Docker image |
| üöÄ Production Deployment | Deploying | Publishing to GitHub Pages |

## üö® Failure Handling

### Test Failures
- **Action:** Pipeline stops, no further phases run
- **Notification:** GitHub status checks show failure
- **Resolution:** Fix failing tests and push again

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Action:** Pipeline continues but vulnerabilities are logged
- **Notification:** Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Resolution:** Review and address vulnerabilities

### Build Failures
- **Action:** Pipeline stops, deployment is skipped
- **Notification:** Build artifacts not created
- **Resolution:** Fix build issues and push again

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### GitHub Actions UI
- Navigate to **Actions** tab in the repository
- Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs
- Each phase shows individual step results

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Test Coverage:** Maintained above 80%
- **Build Time:** Typically 2-3 minutes per phase
- **Security Scan Results:** Review weekly vulnerability reports
- **Deployment Success Rate:** Should be 100% for main branch

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Build Timeouts
- **Cause:** Large dependencies or slow runners
- **Solution:** Optimize dependencies, use caching

#### Test Failures
- **Cause:** Code changes breaking existing functionality
- **Solution:** Run tests locally before pushing

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Cause:** Outdated dependencies or vulnerable code
- **Solution:** Update dependencies, review security reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Integration

### Pre-commit Checks
```bash
# Run tests before pushing
npm run test:coverage

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Build locally to catch issues early
npm run build
```

### Testing Workflow Changes
1. Create a test branch
2. Make workflow modifications
3. Push to trigger pipeline
4. Review results in GitHub Actions
5. Merge to main when satisfied

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations
- **Parallel Builds:** Application and container builds run simultaneously
- **Dependency Caching:** Bun caches dependencies between runs
- **Docker Layer Caching:** Docker builds use cached layers
- **Conditional Deployment:** Only deploys on main branch

### Future Improvements
- **Matrix Builds:** Test on multiple Node.js versions
- **Artifact Reuse:** Share build artifacts between jobs
- **Advanced Caching:** Cache more build artifacts

## üîê Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- No secrets currently required
- GitHub Pages deployment uses built-in authentication

### Access Control
- Workflow runs with minimal required permissions
- Security scanning has read access to code
- Deployment requires write access to Pages

### Vulnerability Handling
- All vulnerabilities are logged and tracked
- Critical vulnerabilities should be addressed immediately
- Regular security reviews recommended

## ü§ù Contributing to CI/CD

### Modifying the Pipeline
1. Edit `.github/workflows/main.yml`
2. Test changes on a feature branch
3. Review workflow runs in GitHub Actions
4. Submit pull request with changes

### Adding New Phases
1. Define new job with descriptive name
2. Set appropriate dependencies using `needs:`
3. Add clear step descriptions
4. Update this documentation

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive job and step names
- Set appropriate dependencies between jobs
- Include proper error handling
- Document any new phases or changes
- Test thoroughly before merging
